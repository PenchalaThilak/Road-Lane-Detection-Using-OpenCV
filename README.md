# ðŸš— Lane Detection with OpenCV and Gradio

This project uses OpenCV to perform lane detection on road videos and provides a simple Gradio web interface to upload a video and see the lane-marked output.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Uses **Canny Edge Detection** and **Hough Line Transform**.
- Applies a **Region of Interest (ROI)** to focus on lane areas.
- Processes the uploaded video and displays the output video with detected lanes.
- Built using **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **Gradio**.
